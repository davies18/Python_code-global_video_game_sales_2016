# Python_code-global_video_game_sales_2016
This project used the video game sales in the 2016 database. The goal of this data transformation exercise were to determine if the average global sales were higher before or after 2005 and to create a new column that labels records before 2005 as ‘pre-2005’ and after 2005 as ‘post-2005’
